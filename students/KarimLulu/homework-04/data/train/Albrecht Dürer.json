    "text": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer (; German: [\u02c8alb\u0281\u025b\u00e7t \u02c8dy\u02d0\u0281\u0250]; 21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528) was a painter, printmaker, and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, D\u00fcrer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. D\u00fcrer is commemorated by both the Lutheran and Episcopal Churches.\n\nD\u00fcrer's vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), are more Gothic than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium.\nD\u00fcrer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective, and ideal proportions.\n\nEarly life (1471-1490)\nD\u00fcrer was born on 21 May 1471, third child and second son of his parents, who had at least fourteen and possibly as many as eighteen children. His father, Albrecht D\u00fcrer the Elder (originally Albrecht Ajt\u00f3si), was a successful goldsmith who in 1455 had moved to Nuremberg from Ajt\u00f3s, near Gyula in Hungary. One of Albrecht's brothers, Hans D\u00fcrer, was also a painter and trained under him. Another of Albrecht's brothers, Endres D\u00fcrer, took over their father's business and was a master goldsmith. The German name \"D\u00fcrer\" is a translation from the Hungarian, \"Ajt\u00f3si\". Initially, it was \"T\u00fcrer\", meaning doormaker, which is \"ajt\u00f3s\" in Hungarian (from \"ajt\u00f3\", meaning door). A door is featured in the coat-of-arms the family acquired. Albrecht D\u00fcrer the Younger later changed \"T\u00fcrer\", his father's diction of the family's surname, to \"D\u00fcrer\", to adapt to the local Nuremberg dialect. Albrecht D\u00fcrer the Elder married Barbara Holper, the daughter of his master when he himself became a master in 1467.\n\nD\u00fcrer's godfather was Anton Koberger, who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year of D\u00fcrer's birth and quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany, eventually owning twenty-four printing-presses and having many offices in Germany and abroad. Koberger's most famous publication was the Nuremberg Chronicle, published in 1493 in German and Latin editions. It contained an unprecedented 1,809 woodcut illustrations (albeit with many repeated uses of the same block) by the Wolgemut workshop. D\u00fcrer may have worked on some of these, as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut.\nBecause D\u00fcrer left autobiographical writings and became very famous by his mid-twenties, his life is well documented by several sources. After a few years of school, D\u00fcrer started to learn the basics of goldsmithing and drawing from his father. Though his father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith, he showed such a precocious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to Michael Wolgemut at the age of fifteen in 1486. A self-portrait, a drawing in silverpoint, is dated 1484 (Albertina, Vienna) \"when I was a child\", as his later inscription says. Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art, in particular woodcuts for books. Nuremberg was then an important and prosperous city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades. It had strong links with Italy, especially Venice, a relatively short distance across the Alps.\n\nWanderjahre and marriage (1490-1494)\nAfter completing his term of apprenticeship, D\u00fcrer followed the common German custom of taking Wanderjahre\u2014in effect gap years \u2014in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas; D\u00fcrer was to spend about four years away. He left in 1490, possibly to work under Martin Schongauer, the leading engraver of Northern Europe, but who died shortly before D\u00fcrer's arrival at Colmar in 1492. It is unclear where D\u00fcrer travelled in the intervening period, though it is likely that he went to Frankfurt and the Netherlands. In Colmar, D\u00fcrer was welcomed by Schongauer's brothers, the goldsmiths Caspar and Paul and the painter Ludwig. In 1493 D\u00fcrer went to Strasbourg, where he would have experienced the sculpture of Nikolaus Gerhaert. D\u00fcrer's first painted self-portrait (now in the Louvre) was painted at this time, probably to be sent back to his fianc\u00e9e in Nuremberg.\nIn early 1492 D\u00fcrer travelled to Basel to stay with another brother of Martin Schongauer, the goldsmith Georg. Very soon after his return to Nuremberg, on 7 July 1494, at the age of 23, D\u00fcrer was married to Agnes Frey following an arrangement made during his absence. Agnes was the daughter of a prominent brass worker (and amateur harpist) in the city. However, no children resulted from the marriage, and with Albrecht the D\u00fcrer name died out. The marriage between Agnes and Albrecht was not a generally happy one, as indicated by the letters of D\u00fcrer in which he quipped to Willibald Pirckheimer in an extremely rough tone about his wife. He called her an \"old crow\" and made other vulgar remarks. Pirckheimer also made no secret of his antipathy towards Agnes, describing her as a miserly shrew with a bitter tongue, who helped cause D\u00fcrer's death at a young age. It is speculated by many scholars Albrecht was bisexual, if not homosexual, due to several of his works containing themes of homosexual desire, as well as the intimate nature of his correspondence with certain very close male friends.\n\nFirst journey to Italy (1494-1495)\nWithin three months of his marriage, D\u00fcrer left for Italy, alone, perhaps stimulated by an outbreak of plague in Nuremberg. He made watercolour sketches as he traveled over the Alps. Some have survived and others may be deduced from accurate landscapes of real places in his later work, for example his engraving Nemesis.\nIn Italy, he went to Venice to study its more advanced artistic world. Through Wolgemut's tutelage, D\u00fcrer had learned how to make prints in drypoint and design woodcuts in the German style, based on the works of Martin Schongauer and the Housebook Master. He also would have had access to some Italian works in Germany, but the two visits he made to Italy had an enormous influence on him. He wrote that Giovanni Bellini was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice. His drawings and engravings show the influence of others, notably Antonio Pollaiuolo with his interest in the proportions of the body, Andrea Mantegna, Lorenzo di Credi and others. D\u00fcrer probably also visited Padua and Mantua on this trip.\n\nReturn to Nuremberg (1495-1505)\nOn his return to Nuremberg in 1495, D\u00fcrer opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this). Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. D\u00fcrer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition.\nIt is now thought unlikely that D\u00fcrer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. D\u00fcrer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.\n\nHis famous series of sixteen great designs for the Apocalypse is dated 1498, as is his engraving of St. Michael Fighting the Dragon. He made the first seven scenes of the Great Passion in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints. The Seven Sorrows Polyptych, commissioned by Frederick III of Saxony in 1496, was executed by D\u00fcrer and his assistants c. 1500. Around 1503-1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the Life of the Virgin, which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the Great Passion, were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers.\nDuring the same period D\u00fcrer trained himself in the difficult art of using the burin to make engravings. It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith. In 1496 he executed the Prodigal Son, which the Italian Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality. He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably Nemesis (1502), The Sea Monster (1498), and Saint Eustace (c. 1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals. His landscapes of this period, such as Pond in the Woods and Willow Mill, are quite different from his earlier watercolours. There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography. He made a number of Madonnas, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures. Prints are highly portable and these works made D\u00fcrer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years.\n\nThe Venetian artist Jacopo de' Barbari, whom D\u00fcrer had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and D\u00fcrer said that he learned much about the new developments in perspective, anatomy, and proportion from him. De' Barbari was unwilling to explain everything he knew, so D\u00fcrer began his own studies, which would become a lifelong preoccupation. A series of extant drawings show D\u00fcrer's experiments in human proportion, leading to the famous engraving of Adam and Eve (1504), which shows his subtlety while using the burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces. This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name.\nD\u00fcrer created large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the Betende H\u00e4nde (Praying Hands) from circa 1508, a study for an apostle in the Heller altarpiece. He continued to make images in watercolour and bodycolour (usually combined), including a number of still lifes of meadow sections or animals, including his Young Hare (1502) and the Great Piece of Turf (1503).\n\nSecond journey to Italy (1505-1507)\nIn Italy, he returned to painting, at first producing a series of works executed in tempera on linen. These include portraits and altarpieces, notably, the Paumgartner altarpiece and the Adoration of the Magi. In early 1506, he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507. By this time D\u00fcrer's engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied. In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of San Bartolomeo. This was the altar-piece known as the Adoration of the Virgin or the Feast of Rose Garlands. It includes portraits of members of Venice's German community, but shows a strong Italian influence. It was subsequently acquired by the Emperor Rudolf II and taken to Prague. Other paintings D\u00fcrer produced in Venice include The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch, Christ among the Doctors (supposedly produced in a mere five days), and a number of smaller works.\n\nNuremberg and the masterworks (1507-1520)\nDespite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians, D\u00fcrer returned to Nuremberg by mid-1507, remaining in Germany until 1520. His reputation had spread throughout Europe and he was on friendly terms and in communication with most of the major artists including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and\u2014mainly through Lorenzo di Credi\u2014Leonardo da Vinci.\nBetween 1507 and 1511 D\u00fcrer worked on some of his most celebrated paintings: Adam and Eve (1507), The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand (1508, for Frederick of Saxony), Virgin with the Iris (1508), the altarpiece Assumption of the Virgin (1509, for Jacob Heller of Frankfurt), and Adoration of the Trinity (1511, for Matthaeus Landauer). During this period he also completed two woodcut series, the Great Passion and the Life of the Virgin, both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the Apocalypse series. The post-Venetian woodcuts show D\u00fcrer's development of chiaroscuro modelling effects, creating a mid-tone throughout the print to which the highlights and shadows can be contrasted.\nOther works from this period include the thirty-seven woodcut subjects of the Little Passion, published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512. Indeed, complaining that painting did not make enough money to justify the time spent when compared to his prints, he produced no paintings from 1513 to 1516. However, in 1513 and 1514 D\u00fcrer created his three most famous engravings: Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513, probably based on Erasmus's treatise Enchiridion militis Christiani), St. Jerome in his Study, and the much-debated Melencolia I (both 1514). Further outstanding pen and ink drawings of D\u00fcrer\u00b4s period of art work of 1513 were drafts for his friend Willibald Prickheimer. These drafts were later used to design the famous chandeliers lusterweibchen.\nIn 1515, he created his woodcut of a Rhinoceros which had arrived in Lisbon from a written description and sketch by another artist, without ever seeing the animal himself. An image of the Indian rhinoceros, the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known and was still used in some German school science text-books as late as last century. In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including the woodblocks for the first western printed star charts in 1515 and portraits in tempera on linen in 1516.\n\nPatronage of Maximilian I\nFrom 1512, Maximilian I became D\u00fcrer's major patron. His commissions included The Triumphal Arch, a vast work printed from 192 separate blocks, the symbolism of which is partly informed by Pirckheimer's translation of Horapollo's Hieroglyphica. The design program and explanations were devised by Johannes Stabius, the architectural design by the master builder and court-painter J\u00f6rg K\u00f6lderer and the woodcutting itself by Hieronymous Andreae, with D\u00fcrer as designer-in-chief. The Arch was followed by The Triumphal Procession, the program of which was worked out in 1512 by Marx Treitz-Saurwein and includes woodcuts by Albrecht Altdorfer and Hans Springinklee, as well as D\u00fcrer.\nD\u00fcrer worked with pen on the marginal images for an edition of the Emperor's printed Prayer-Book; these were quite unknown until facsimiles were published in 1808 as part of the first book published in lithography. D\u00fcrer's work on the book was halted for an unknown reason, and the decoration was continued by artists including Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Baldung. D\u00fcrer also made several portraits of the Emperor, including one shortly before Maximilian's death in 1519.\n\nJourney to the Netherlands (1520-1521)\nMaximilian's death came at a time when D\u00fcrer was concerned he was losing \"my sight and freedom of hand\" (perhaps caused by arthritis) and increasingly affected by the writings of Martin Luther. In July 1520 D\u00fcrer made his fourth and last major journey, to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor, Charles V, who was to be crowned at Aachen. D\u00fcrer journeyed with his wife and her maid via the Rhine to Cologne and then to Antwerp, where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in silverpoint, chalk and charcoal. In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to Cologne (where he admired the painting of Stefan Lochner), Nijmegen, 's-Hertogenbosch, Bruges (where he saw Michelangelo's Madonna of Bruges), Ghent (where he admired van Eyck's altarpiece), and Zeeland.\nD\u00fcrer took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much. This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time. Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented. While providing valuable documentary evidence, D\u00fcrer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one. For example, D\u00fcrer offered his last portrait of Maximilian to his daughter, Margaret of Austria, but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after Margaret disliked the portrait and declined to accept it. During this trip he also met Bernard van Orley, Jan Provoost, Gerard Horenbout, Jean Mone, Joachim Patinir and Tommaso Vincidor, though he did not, it seems, meet Quentin Matsys.\nAt the request of Christian II of Denmark, D\u00fcrer went to Brussels to paint the King's portrait. There he saw \"the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land\"\u2014the Aztec treasure that Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico. D\u00fcrer wrote that this treasure \"was much more beautiful to me than miracles. These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 florins\". D\u00fcrer also appears to have been collecting for his own cabinet of curiosities, and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of coral, some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the East Indies.\nHaving secured his pension, D\u00fcrer finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness\u2014perhaps malaria\u2014which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work.\n\nFinal years in Nuremberg (1521-1528)\nOn his return to Nuremberg, D\u00fcrer worked on a number of grand projects with religious themes, including a crucifixion scene and a Sacra Conversazione, though neither was completed. This may have been due in part to his declining health, but perhaps also because of the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on geometry and perspective, the proportions of men and horses, and fortification.\nHowever, one consequence of this shift in emphasis was that during the last years of his life, D\u00fcrer produced comparatively little as an artist. In painting, there was only a portrait of Hieronymus Holtzschuher, a Madonna and Child (1526), Salvator Mundi (1526), and two panels showing St. John with St. Peter in background and St. Paul with St. Mark in the background. This last great work, the Four Apostles, was given by D\u00fcrer to the City of Nuremberg\u2014although he was given 100 guilders in return.\n\nAs for engravings, D\u00fcrer's work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise. The portraits include Cardinal-Elector Albert of Mainz; Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony; the humanist scholar Willibald Pirckheimer; Philipp Melanchthon, and Erasmus of Rotterdam. For those of the Cardinal, Melanchthon, and D\u00fcrer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, D\u00fcrer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach.\nDespite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, D\u00fcrer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend Willibald Pirckheimer, whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images. He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. D\u00fcrer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. \"The Four Books on Measurement\" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on mathematics in German, as well as being cited later by Galileo and Kepler. The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527. \"The Four Books on Human Proportion\" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.\nD\u00fcrer died in Nuremberg at the age of 56, leaving an estate valued at 6,874 florins\u2014a considerable sum. His large house (purchased in 1509 from the heirs of the astronomer Bernhard Walther), where his workshop was located and where his widow lived until her death in 1539, remains a prominent Nuremberg landmark. It is now a museum. He is buried in the Johannisfriedhof cemetery.\n\nD\u00fcrer and the Reformation\nD\u00fcrer's writings suggest that he may have been sympathetic to Martin Luther's ideas, though it is unclear if he ever left the Catholic Church. D\u00fcrer wrote of his desire to draw Luther in his diary in 1520: \"And God help me that I may go to Dr. Martin Luther; thus I intend to make a portrait of him with great care and engrave him on a copper plate to create a lasting memorial of the Christian man who helped me overcome so many difficulties.\" In a letter to Nicholas Kratzer in 1524, D\u00fcrer wrote \"because of our Christian faith we have to stand in scorn and danger, for we are reviled and called heretics\". Most tellingly, Pirckheimer wrote in a letter to Johann Tscherte in 1530: \"I confess that in the beginning I believed in Luther, like our Albert of blessed memory ... but as anyone can see, the situation has become worse.\" D\u00fcrer may even have contributed to the Nuremberg City Council's mandating Lutheran sermons and services in March 1525. Notably, D\u00fcrer had contacts with various reformers, such as Zwingli, Andreas Karlstadt, Melanchthon, Erasmus and Cornelius Grapheus from whom D\u00fcrer received Luther's Babylonian Captivity in 1520.\n\nD\u00fcrer's later works have also been claimed to show Protestant sympathies. For example, his woodcut of The Last Supper of 1523 has often been understood to have an evangelical theme, focussing as it does on Christ espousing the Gospel, as well the inclusion of the Eucharistic cup, an expression of Protestant utraquism, although this interpretation has been questioned. The delaying of the engraving of St Philip, completed in 1523 but not distributed until 1526, may have been due to D\u00fcrer's uneasiness with images of Saints; even if D\u00fcrer was not an iconoclast, in his last years he evaluated and questioned the role of art in religion.\n\nLegacy and influence\nD\u00fcrer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations, especially in printmaking, the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were predominantly in private collections located in only a few cities. His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as Raphael, Titian, and Parmigianino, all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work.\nHis work in engraving seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the \"Little Masters\" who attempted few large engravings but continued D\u00fcrer's themes in small, rather cramped compositions. Lucas van Leyden was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of D\u00fcrer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds (Giulio Campagnola, Giovanni Battista Palumba, Benedetto Montagna and Cristofano Robetta), or whole prints (Marcantonio Raimondi and Agostino Veneziano). However, D\u00fcrer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also.\nIn painting, D\u00fcrer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles. His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style. D\u00fcrer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the D\u00fcrer Renaissance of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German nationalism from 1870 to 1945.\nD\u00fcrer's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by D'Arcy Thompson in his book On Growth and Form.\nThe Lutheran Church remembers D\u00fcrer as a great Christian annually on April 6, along with Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Burgkmair. The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (United States) remembers him, Cranach and Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald on August 5.\n\nTheoretical works\nIn all his theoretical works, in order to communicate his theories in the German language rather than in Latin, D\u00fcrer used graphic expressions based on a vernacular, craftsmen's language. For example, \"Schneckenlinie\" (\"snail-line\") was his term for a spiral form. Thus, D\u00fcrer contributed to the expansion in German prose which Martin Luther had begun with his translation of the Bible.\n\nFour Books on Measurement\nD\u00fcrer's work on geometry is called the Four Books on Measurement (Underweysung der Messung mit dem Zirckel und Richtscheyt or Instructions for Measuring with Compass and Ruler). The first book focuses on linear geometry. D\u00fcrer's geometric constructions include helices, conchoids and epicycloids. He also draws on Apollonius, and Johannes Werner's 'Libellus super viginti duobus elementis conicis' of 1522.\nThe second book moves onto two dimensional geometry, i.e. the construction of regular polygons. Here D\u00fcrer favours the methods of Ptolemy over Euclid. The third book applies these principles of geometry to architecture, engineering and typography.\nIn architecture D\u00fcrer cites Vitruvius but elaborates his own classical designs and columns. In typography, D\u00fcrer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here D\u00fcrer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention.\nIn all these, D\u00fcrer shows the objects as nets. Finally, D\u00fcrer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that D\u00fcrer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although D\u00fcrer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, D\u00fcrer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.\n\nFour Books on Human Proportion\nD\u00fcrer's work on human proportions is called the Four Books on Human Proportion (Vier B\u00fccher von Menschlicher Proportion) of 1528. The first book was mainly composed by 1512/13 and completed by 1523, showing five differently constructed types of both male and female figures, all parts of the body expressed in fractions of the total height. D\u00fcrer based these constructions on both Vitruvius and empirical observations of, \"two to three hundred living persons\", in his own words. The second book includes eight further types, broken down not into fractions but an Albertian system, which D\u00fcrer probably learned from Francesco di Giorgio's 'De harmonica mundi totius' of 1525. In the third book, D\u00fcrer gives principles by which the proportions of the figures can be modified, including the mathematical simulation of convex and concave mirrors; here D\u00fcrer also deals with human physiognomy. The fourth book is devoted to the theory of movement.\nAppended to the last book, however, is a self-contained essay on aesthetics, which D\u00fcrer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'. D\u00fcrer rejected Alberti's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety. Nonetheless, D\u00fcrer still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code. In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), na\u00efve approval ('Wohlgefallen') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass'). However, unlike Alberti and Leonardo, D\u00fcrer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images. Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, D\u00fcrer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or inspired to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'. In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things. D\u00fcrer's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that \"one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year\".\n\nGallery\nPaintings\n\nWatercolours\n\nDrawings and engravings\n\nList of works\nFor lists of Albrecht D\u00fcrer's works, see:\nList of paintings by Albrecht D\u00fcrer\nList of engravings by D\u00fcrer\nList of woodcuts by D\u00fcrer\n\nNotes\nReferences\nChristine Demele.
